Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

Task Overview

This project is part of the **Data Analyst Internship (Task 5)** and focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to extract meaningful patterns, relationships, and insights from the data using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- File used: `train.csv`

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## EDA Highlights

- Checked data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
- Visualized univariate distributions (Age, Sex, Survived).
- Compared survival rates by gender, class, and age.
- Analyzed correlations using a **heatmap** of numeric features.
- Generated a **pairplot** for feature interaction analysis.

## Key Insights

- **Females had a higher survival rate** than males.
- **1st Class passengers** were more likely to survive.
- **Age distribution** showed younger passengers had higher chances of survival.
- Strong correlation between **Fare and Passenger Class**.
- No strong correlation found between Age and Survival (numerically).
